Abstract: For the refactor project, I exerted my due dilligence to ensure that the website was concise, professional, and aesthetically pleasing.
I went so far as to change the title and spelling of the company. I am cogent of the reality that this will never be okay unless I'm physically working for the company.
I incorporated Sting's "Brand New Day". I believe that the limit for using someone else's copyrighted work in a non-educational setting is 13 seconds. However, I believe that covers are okay as long as royalties are paid(I think it's a cabaret license). In summation, I know that I super duper cannot use real Sting on a professional webpage. In the future, I might record a snippet myself. four boxes with the four titles and four images. I was not successful. I was able to generate a skeleton of something that will be much greater in the near future(and hopefully I will be able to code colors by then).
Additionally, I incorporated the advert line "Have A Brand New Day", which might be slightly better than "Have a Rome and Michelle Day".
I took care to make both paragraph titles and content more succinct and marketable.I also took out extraneous code. In an attempt to replace the non-functioning images with existing working images, I did not succeed this time. 
Headers and paragraph coding were fixed, in addition to comma splices, etc. Bullet points were also reformatted and(I paragraphs were retitled).All of my commits have line numbers and subsequent change.
Built With: Flashing Mermaid Productions VS, Github, YouTube, GeeksforGeeks "Try It" Component(even though they redirected me to an IQ Quiz the first time I was coding this). Lesson learned.
